        Asynchronous Programming is a way of writing code that allows a program 
        to do multiple tasks at the same time. 
        Time consuming operations like fetching data from the internet, 
        writing to a database, reading from a file, 
        and downloading a file can be performed without blocking 
        the main thread of execution.
